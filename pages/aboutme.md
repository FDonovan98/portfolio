<h3>My Path To Art</h3>
Hi! My name's Frost, I'm currently working through a MA Game Art degree and am <i>really</i> excited about entering the industry soon as a games artist. Currently, I'm most interested in environment art roles, but I'm pretty flexible and could be interested in both tech art and material art roles, if the right one comes along. My background and path up till now has been pretty... non-traditional. During my undergrad I was on a BSc Computing For Games course, basically programming for video games, so my bachelors is in programming, but our course was very focused on actually developing games as multidisciplinary teams, so for almost all of it I was actually acting as a producer, and now I'm an artist! I should probably explain that a little more. <br>
So I fell into production, in my first year team we were fairly directionless, and it became clear that we wouldn't actually get much done without someone helping to steer and organise the team, so I stepped up while still doing some programming on our project. Then as I moved into second and third year the core team stayed together, and I was enjoying it and the team found it a boon so I stayed as a producer. I was always trying to push my skills and knowledge, doing a lot of reading and watching talks, and in my third year this drive led me to learning more about art production. Being a good producer meant I needed an understanding of everything that goes into a game, so getting a handle on the basics of game art and having experience using their pipelines, rather than just knowing them in theory, would allow me to better empathise with artists and better understand what a given task would actually involve. To this end I started learning both 2D and 3D, started going to life drawing and looking at learning resources, and asking our artists to run me through their process as they worked, which they very kindly did. <br>
That's when it started to click for me. While I'd always admired an artists skill, growing up art as a career had always been a joke rather than an actual option. So here I was, taking a serious look into art as a career for practically the first time, and I had this moment of "Oh gosh. Oh I really like this.", which was then closely followed by "Oh no... I might want to do this more than production.".


Hi! I'm Frost, I'm a passionate artist and a full time nerd. I love film, exploring new creative pursuits, and have recently got into Warhammer 40k. I've also run a few D&D campaigns in the past and would love to again when I have time.
 
I've got experience running game development teams, taking projects from <b>initial conception to publishing</b> on Itch and Steam, always with a focus on maintaining <b>healthy and flexible practices</b>. I'm experienced with <b>Git</b>, <b>Jira</b>, <b>Confluence</b>, <b>Trello</b>, <b>Unity</b>, as well as <b>Agile</b> and <b>Scrum</b> theory and methodology. I also <b>started my own studio</b> while at university to publish games.

I'm <b>graduating in 2023</b> from Falmouth University, and am actively <b>looking for Junior Environment/ Technical Artist roles</b> where I can learn and grow, as well as being available for <b>freelance</b> work. If any of this sounds like I could be a good fit for you or your company, please don't hesitate to get in touch!

<h3>Production</h3>
I am experienced with <b>Jira</b> and <b>Trello</b>, having used them for task tracking over the last three years. Jira is awesome, the <b>automation</b> is a blessing, and <b>story points</b> are excellent for allowing planning with evidence that you can point to, rather than just experience and vibes. This has been essential for reassuring scope concerns that have come from our supervisors, and allowing us to intelligently and continuously adjust the scope of the project as needed. This practice has already highlighted potential scoping problems within the initial plans for our latest project. As we could foresee this early, we've been able to <b>adjust scope</b> and replan, rather than finding out we had over scoped late in the project and having to cut half finished assets. I talk about this in a little more in my second paragraph <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2021/10/01/castan.html">here</a>.

I've also made use of <b>story tags</b> to help with sprint planning and ensuring even workload across the team, first on Trello and now within Jira. This, combined with custom board filters using <b><a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/6820/scriptrunner-for-jira?tab=overview&hosting=cloud">ScriptRunner</a></b> has made it really easy for developers on the team to quickly find tasks relating to any discipline.

I have experience doing <b>release planning</b>, assisted by Jira's <b>version reports</b>. This has an excellent tool, allowing us to see at a glance if we're on track, as well as providing an easy and clear way to communicate this. I've also made use of different <b>release versions</b> to help with story prioritisation.

I have also begun experimenting with <b>Continuous Development</b> pipelines using <b><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a></b> and <b><a href="https://game.ci/">GameCI</a></b>. I've set up our latest pipeline so that a pull request is automatically created every night at midnight, which then triggers automated running of unit tests. If these pass the project is then built and uploaded to <b>Steam</b>, so it is immediately available on a "<b>Daily Builds</b>" branch on Steam. I am also writing my <b>dissertation</b> on the effectiveness of Continuous Development pipelines within university level teams. This is currently a work in progress, but I would be happy to provide a link upon request.

I am familiar with <b>Confluence</b> for documentation, having switched to it after previously using collections of <b>Google Docs</b>. This has been a good improvement as documentation can be ordered and can reference each other, rather than having a large collection of separate documents that all have to be self contained. This lets each document be much shorter and to the point, significantly increasing readability.

<span class="image left"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/gnglogo.png" alt=""/></span> In 2020 I <b>started my own company</b>, Glass Nomad Games, to publish games through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Glass%20Nomad%20Games"><b>Steam</b></a>. We've been running the company <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnomadgames"><b>Twitter</b></a> in order to advertise our games before release and build a small following to improve the amount of traction we get upon release. I have handled all of the legal research, <b>registering the company</b> and setting up a business bank account, as well as handling <b>IP agreements</b> with the development team.
