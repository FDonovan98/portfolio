I'm a passionate producer and full time nerd. I love film, exploring new creative pursuits, and have recently got into Warhammer 40k. I've also run a few D&D campaigns in the past.

I've got experience running game dev teams, taking projects from initial conception to publishing on Itch and Steam, always with a focus on maintaining healthy and flexible practices. I'm experienced with Git, Jira, Trello, Unity, as well as Agile and Scrum theory and methodology. I've also started my own studio, Glass Nomad Games, to publish games made throughout University.

I'm graduating from Falmouth University in 2022, and am actively looking for Junior or Graduate Producer roles where I can learn and grow, as well as being available as a freelance Producer or Programmer. If any of this sounds like I could be a good fit for you or your company, please don't hesitate to get in touch!

<h2>Skills</h2>
Experienced with <b>Jira</b> and <b>Trello</b>, having used them for task tracking over the last three years. Jira is awesome, <b>automation</b> is a blessing, and <b>story points</b> are excellent for allowing planning with evidence that you can point to, rather than just experience and vibes. Has been essential for reassuring scope concerns that have come from supervisors. Already highlighted potential scope problems, current game plan was to produce two levels, although after some analysis, breaking down tasks and pointing them up we realised that was likely out of scope. Given we've found this out early, we've been able to <b>rescope regularly</b>, including redesigning our second level to be based off of cheaper, modular assets, rather than ending up in the position where we have to abandon a half finished level just before release because we realise last minute we wouldn't have time to finish it.

<b>Release planning</b> assisted by Jira's <b>version reports</b> is excellent, allows us to see if our backlog is on track, as well as providing an easy way for the team and supervisors to see if we're on track. Use of different <b>release versions</b> to help with story prioritisation.
