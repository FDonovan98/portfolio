lead concepting discussions, with a mind for scope and team composition. There were several major concerns at the beginning of the project as the game jam was only 3 weeks, it was a development team that hadn't worked together before, and a majority of developers were new to game development. 
Given that a majority of games, even smaller indie titles, are produced over several years not weeks (Dana 2022) it was clear that we would need to design a concept that was very focused, both mechanically and environmentally. This was especially true as the team had not worked together before, so would be progressing through 4 stages of team work (Tuckman, B.W., 1965, p.384) so wouldn't be as productive as it would be possible for us to be if we were already familiar with working together. Working with developers new to game development meant they were unaware of industry standard 3D pipelines (Intel 2018), so it was important to introduce them to these before commencing work as they are beneficial in several ways, such as <EXPLAIN WHY 3D PIPELINES GOOD><REFERENCE BENEFITS OF 3D PIPELINE>.

these three fed into primary concern driver ideation, which was scope <REFERENCE WHAT IS SCOPE>. overscoping can cause <REFERENCES DOWNSIDES OF OVERSCOPING>. We explored several ideas for managing scope, such as designing a lot of modularity and reusability into our environments and mechanics <REFERENCE MODULARITY>. We began ideation with a session of brainstorming, which served the dual purpose of acting as a team building exercise (Chandler, H.M., 2009, p. 221), allowing us to explore all ideas without committing to something that was out of scope.

Alongside this game jam I have been working on improving my art fundamentals, and have been attending undergrad lectures as part of this. This has included study of the Andrew Loomis proportion charts for both the body (2021) and the head (2021). While I had seen these before I hadn't done any proper focused studies on them, and while I still need to do that I have begun applying the basics in sketching silhouettes as well as during Life Drawing. Having internalised the basic "8 heads" proportions I'm finding they are becoming more instinctual, as well as giving me incredibly useful reference to pull from. As such, these drawings have become the start of, to borrow a phrase from my programming work, my debugging checklist for when I am drawing humanoids and the drawing is feeling off. As mentioned, I have been doing silhouette studies as a method of practice, both for my understanding of proportion given that I can do a lot of figures very quickly, and because producing silhouettes is an important part of concept art so will be a useful skill to demonstrate I can do for industry <REFERENCE SILHOUETTES IN INDUSTRY>.
