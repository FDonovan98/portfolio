I'm a passionate producer and full time nerd. I love film, exploring new creative pursuits, and have recently got into Warhammer 40k. I've also run a few D&D campaigns in the past.

I've got experience running game development teams, taking projects from initial conception to publishing on Itch and Steam, always with a focus on maintaining healthy and flexible practices. I'm experienced with Git, Jira, Confluence, Trello, Unity, as well as Agile and Scrum theory and methodology. I've also started my own studio, Glass Nomad Games, to publish games made throughout University.

I'm graduating from Falmouth University in 2022, and am actively looking for Junior or Graduate Producer roles where I can learn and grow, as well as being available for freelance work. If any of this sounds like I could be a good fit for you or your company, please don't hesitate to get in touch!

<h2>Skills</h2>
I am experienced with <b>Jira</b> and <b>Trello</b>, having used them for task tracking over the last three years. Jira is awesome, the <b>automation</b> is a blessing, and <b>story points</b> are excellent for allowing planning with evidence that you can point to, rather than just experience and vibes. This has been essential for reassuring scope concerns that have come from our supervisors, and allowing us to intelligently and continuously adjust the scope of the project as needed. This practice has already highlighted potential scoping problems within the initial plans for our latest project.As we could foresee this early, we've been able to <b>adjust scope</b> and replan, rather than finding out we had over scoped late in the project and having to cut half finished assets. I talk about this in a little more detail <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2021/10/01/SIlverback.html">here</a>. <br>
Use of <b>story tags</b> to help with sprint planning and ensuring even workload across the team. Also combine this with custom board filters using <b><a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/6820/scriptrunner-for-jira?tab=overview&hosting=cloud">ScriptRunner</a></b> to make it easier for developers to quickly find tasks relating to a discipline.

<b>Release planning</b> assisted by Jira's <b>version reports</b> is excellent, allows us to see if our backlog is on track, as well as providing an easy way for the team and supervisors to see if we're on track. Use of different <b>release versions</b> to help with story prioritisation.

Experience with <b>Continuous Development</b> pipelines using <b><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a></b> and <b><a href="https://game.ci/">GameCI</a></b>. Automatic creation of a pull request every night at midnight, which then triggers automated running of unit tests. If these pass the project is then built and uploaded to <b>Steam</b>, so it is immediately available on a "<b>Daily Builds</b>" branch on Steam. Writing my <b>dissertation</b> on the effectiveness of Continuous Development on university level teams, current work in progress but link is available upon request.

Familiar with using <b>Confluence</b> for documentation, after switching to it after previously using collections of <b>Google Docs</b>. Has been an improvement as docs can be ordered and reference each other, rather than having collections of separate docs that all have to be self contained.
