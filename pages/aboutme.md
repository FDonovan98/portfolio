I'm a passionate producer and full time nerd. I love film, exploring new creative pursuits, and have recently got into Warhammer 40k. I've also run a few D&D campaigns in the past.

I've got experience running game development teams, taking projects from initial conception to publishing on Itch and Steam, always with a focus on maintaining healthy and flexible practices. I'm experienced with Git, Jira, Confluence, Trello, Unity, as well as Agile and Scrum theory and methodology. I've also started my own studio, Glass Nomad Games, to publish games made throughout University.

I'm graduating from Falmouth University in 2022, and am actively looking for Junior or Graduate Producer roles where I can learn and grow, as well as being available for freelance work. If any of this sounds like I could be a good fit for you or your company, please don't hesitate to get in touch! 

<h2>Skills</h2>
I am experienced with <b>Jira</b> and <b>Trello</b>, having used them for task tracking over the last three years. Jira is awesome, the <b>automation</b> is a blessing, and <b>story points</b> are excellent for allowing planning with evidence that you can point to, rather than just experience and vibes. This has been essential for reassuring scope concerns that have come from our supervisors, and allowing us to intelligently and continuously adjust the scope of the project as needed. This practice has already highlighted potential scoping problems within the initial plans for our latest project.As we could foresee this early, we've been able to <b>adjust scope</b> and replan, rather than finding out we had over scoped late in the project and having to cut half finished assets. I talk about this in a little more detail <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2021/10/01/Silverback.html">here</a>.

I've also made use of <b>story tags</b> to help with sprint planning and ensuring even workload across the team, first on Trello and now within Jira. This, combined with custom board filters using <b><a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/6820/scriptrunner-for-jira?tab=overview&hosting=cloud">ScriptRunner</a></b> has made it really easy for developers on the team to quickly find tasks relating to any discipline.

I have experience doing <b>release planning</b>, assisted by Jira's <b>version reports</b>. This has an excellent tool, allowing us to see at a glance if we're on track, as well as providing an easy and clear way to communicate this. I've also made use of different <b>release versions</b> to help with story prioritisation.

I have also begun experimenting with <b>Continuous Development</b> pipelines using <b><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a></b> and <b><a href="https://game.ci/">GameCI</a></b>. I've set up our latest pipeline so that a pull request is automatically created every night at midnight, which then triggers automated running of unit tests. If these pass the project is then built and uploaded to <b>Steam</b>, so it is immediately available on a "<b>Daily Builds</b>" branch on Steam. I am also writing my <b>dissertation</b> on the effectiveness of Continuous Development pipelines within university level teams. This is currently a work in progress, but I would be happy to provide a link upon request.

I am familiar with <b>Confluence</b> for documentation, having switched to it after previously using collections of <b>Google Docs</b>. This has been a good improvement as documentation can be ordered and can reference each other, rather than having a large collection of separate documents that all have to be self contained. This lets each document be much shorter and to the point, significantly increasing readability.
