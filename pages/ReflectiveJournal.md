<h2>Week 3: 03/10/22 - 09/10/22</h2>
<!-- Sprint review, escalation and conclusion of team difficulties by individual leaving the group -->

Ran sprint retrospective, guiding the team as we did an internal demonstration of the latest build, went through what had worked well, what had caused problems, and things that could be done to improve, throughout the last sprint. This was then used to help guide the tasks for the next sprint, alongside the project backlog. This allows and encourages developers to share problems they have encountered and allows the team to collaboratively generate solutions, encouraging trust and understanding across disciplines<REFERENCE>. This practice was primarily shaped by the theory within the book 'Agile Game Development With Scrum' by Clinton Keith (2010), as well as supporting research from various websites, including Scrum.org (Scrum.org, n.d.).

Alongside this game jam I have been working on improving my art fundamentals, and have been attending undergrad lectures as part of this. This has included study of the Andrew Loomis proportion charts for both the body (2021a) and the head (2021b). While I had seen these before I hadn't done any proper focused studies on them, and while I still need to do that I have begun applying the basics in sketching silhouettes as well as during Life Drawing. Having internalised the basic "8 heads" proportions I'm finding they are becoming more instinctual, as well as giving me incredibly useful reference to pull from. As such, these drawings have become the start of, to borrow a phrase from my programming work, my debugging checklist for when I am drawing humanoids and the drawing is feeling off. As mentioned, I have been doing silhouette studies as a method of practice, both for my understanding of proportion given that I can do a lot of figures very quickly, and because producing silhouettes is an important part of concept art so will be a useful skill to demonstrate I can do for industry <REFERENCE SILHOUETTES IN INDUSTRY>.

<h2>Week 2: 26/09/22 - 02/10/22</h2>
Following from my decisions in Week 1 regarding undergrad modules, I have arranged to meet with my academic tutor on a regular basis to check I am on track for my goals for the course. This has value due to them having more experience in the field, so they will likely have a better perspective on if my skill progression is on track, as well as having more experience of students progressing through the masters so would be able to highlight if there were areas that I was progressing slower than expected with. This then allows me to refocus my practice, or seek extra support, in these areas.

<h2>Week 1: 19/09/22 - 25/09/22</h2>
This was the first week of the Game Art Masters at Falmouth University, which was incredibly busy as I attended lectures for seven different undergrad modules, as well as the lectures for my masters module. While intense, this aided in 'evaluating' the undergrad modules, as I wanted to attend them to aid in the development of my artistic skills and knowledge, but given I have limited time per week I can't attend every undergrad lecture. I decided to attend first year Concept Art and Environment Art lectures as these aligned with my desired future role of Junior Environment Artist, preferably at Jagex, building on both my 2D and 3D skills. More generally, I am wanting to develop my skills towards being able to design, concept, and produce environments for players to explore, taking into account artistic considerations such as atmosphere, lighting, colour palette etc., and combining this with design considerations like how the area is revealed to the player and guiding them along specific paths and highlighting important areas or items. Looking at the Jagex job posting for the role (jobs.lever.co, n.d.) one thing they want as a bonus is traditional 2D art skills, which further increases the value of the first year Concept Art module for me, as well providing a reason for me to continue attending Life Drawing sessions.

This week began a three week game jam, in which I lead concepting discussions due to me being one of the more experience developers within our team, and having a good overview of the entire game development process, not just a single discipline. This is due to me having actively developed this broader view point during my previous projects when working as a Producer. This perspective aided in the team being able to design a concept with a mind for what was possible given the available scope and team composition. At the beginning of the project, there were three major concerns: the game jam was only 3 weeks, it was a development team that hadn't worked together before, and a majority of developers were new to game development. 
Given that a majority of games, even smaller indie titles, are produced over several years not weeks (Dana 2022) it was clear that we would need to design a concept that was very focused, both mechanically and environmentally. This was especially true as the team had not worked together before, so would be progressing through 4 stages of team work (Tuckman, B.W., 1965, p.384) and wouldn't be as productive as a team who we were already familiar with working together. Finally, Working with developers new to game development meant they were unaware of industry standard 3D pipelines (Intel 2018), so it was important to introduce them to these both before and during the project. This allowed all developers to be using the same optimised workflows, increasing efficiency and enabling easier communication and cooperation between developers.

These three factors fed into my primary concern during ideation, which was scope, as overscoping can cause crunch, increase developer stress, and result in features being cut close to a deadline. We explored several ideas for managing scope, such as designing a lot of modularity and reusability into our environments and mechanics, effectively increasing the <i>value</i> of each piece of work produced. We began ideation with a session of brainstorming, which served the dual purpose of acting as a team building exercise (Chandler, H.M., 2009, p. 221), allowing us to explore all ideas without committing to something that was out of scope.
