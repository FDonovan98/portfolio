Project intro, outline

Initially wanted to focus on atmosphere. Also used as an opportunity to investigate different workflows and processes, practicing concepting & in both Maya and zBrush, learning and eperimenting with the zModeller brush. Also investigated retopology across the two platforms, spending a significant amount of time experimenting with retopology in zBrush using zRemesher, DynaMesh, and zSphere, as well as retopology in Maya using QuadDraw, and some light research into retopology in Blender as well. 
Findings below
zbrush
organics, dynamesh followed by zremesher provides very clean, regular topology. While excellent for curved surfaces, such as a lot of organics, this regularity has limitations. For organics, the topology can be guided to create good flow around features, such as eyes, and while the density can be guided using weight painting it often requires adjustment after, especially for hard surface work. I found it was adding much more geometry than needed in order to keep uniformity, bloating the polycount. This then required me going in and manually removing redundant edge loops, which is not ideal.
I also looked into using zSphere, however after some time of using it it appears to be equivalent to Maya's quaddraw, however lacks features and is harder to use, making it a less preferably option to Maya.

<h2>Pre-Production</h2>
Inpsired by gothic architecture and mood, also pulling from 40k for symbolism and atmosphere
focused primarily on building itself, neglected shot composition until later in the project

Have designed asset to be able to create a modular kit to allow faster completion time (it's much quicker to unwrap an element once than 16 times) and allow for easy construction in engine. Hope to construct kit in such a way that building new buildings in engine would be quick and efficient.
