Watch the shadows, watch your ammo, and watch each other. Something is out there, and its coming for you. In the first game from indie studio Glass Nomad, you and a squad of your friends will be pitched against an opponent who is not only fast, stealthy, and a lethal hunter, but is also controlled by another player.
