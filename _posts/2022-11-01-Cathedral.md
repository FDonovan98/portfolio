Project intro, outline

<h2>Pre-Production</h2>
Inpsired by gothic architecture and mood, also pulling from 40k for symbolism and atmosphere
focused primarily on building itself, neglected shot composition until later in the project

Have designed asset to be able to create a modular kit to allow faster completion time (it's much quicker to unwrap an element once than 16 times) and allow for easy construction in engine. Hope to construct kit in such a way that building new buildings in engine would be quick and efficient.
